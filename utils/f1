                       Welcome to "No Security Corp.'s"
                         Information Company Portal!!

We had a great picnic the other day - thanks to everyone who helped out. It was
unfortunate that we got attacked by the wild marmots towards the end, and we
hope Marie M. has a speedy recovery - flowers and cards can be sent to the
North Annex of "Our Lady of Unfortunate Demise, Hospital and Backhoe Rental".
We will post pictures of the picnic soon, so check back later.

ATTENTION:
Important! We will be releasing our updated anti-marmot stun gun next week, but
we need volunteers to test out the devices beforehand. If anyone is interested,
we will be testing all next week out back of the chemical shed. Be sure to
bring a mouthguard, as we've substantially increased the voltage on this
upgraded product - we really don't want any more broken teeth or bleeding
tongues like last time we tested the guns. Remember, safety first!

And speaking of the chemical shed, can people please remember to replace the
lids to the drums after use? We had yet another accident where someone fell in
while on their smoke break. Luckily, the spillage that resulted from the
accident seeped into the ground this time, so we don't have to worry about
fires again. But just to be sure, we're moving the designated smoking area from
the chemical shed to the saw mill located in the lumber yard. We know it's a
farther walk, but thank you for your attention to this issue.
